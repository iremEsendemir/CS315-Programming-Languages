# CS315 – Programming Languages Repository

This repository includes coursework for CS315 at Bilkent University, containing two team projects and two individual homework assignments.

---

### Project 1 – Lexical Analyzer
Designed a language using BNF and implemented a lexical analyzer with `lex` with a team. Includes test programs and full documentation.
- **Part A**: BNF grammar and language design including real number operations, conditional statements, I/O, functions, and data structures.
- **Part B**: Implemented a lexical analyzer using lex.
- **Part C**: Tested with three example programs to ensure all tokens are correctly recognized.

### Project 2 – Parser
Built a `yacc` parser for the same language with a team. Handles syntax validation, error reporting, and uses the scanner from Project 1. Includes test programs and full documentation.
- **Part A**: Expanded language definition with execution entry point, declaration rules, operator precedence, and parameter passing.
- **Part B**: Implemented a complete parser that recognizes valid syntax and provides meaningful error messages.
- **Part C**: Tested using correct and intentionally incorrect programs to validate syntax checking.

### Homework 1 – Arrays Comparison
Compared array support across Dart, Go, JavaScript, Kotlin, PHP, Python, and Rust. Includes code examples and evaluation of each language’s array handling.


Topics covered:
  - Legal subscript types
  - Range checking
  - Ragged arrays
  - Initialization
  - Slicing
  - Operators

### Homework 2 – Multiple-way Selection
Compared `switch`, `match`, and equivalent constructs in Dart, Go, JavaScript, Kotlin, PHP, Python, and Rust. Includes code examples and evaluation of each language’s multiple-way selection statements.

Topics covered:
  - Control expression types
  - Case segment structure
  - Execution flow rules
  - Default/unmatched case handling
